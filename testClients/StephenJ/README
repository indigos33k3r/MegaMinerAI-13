SUP NERDS

This is my test AI. It has lots of asserts for things that I think should
always be true when the AI is running. So it may not work all the time, but
if it fails that's probably not good because it's pretty conservative stuff.

It leverages by seastar library which is a A* implementation in C/C++ and
is accessed using a linked library. (https://github.com/scj7t4/seastar)

It also uses my vexulizer library to visualize the game. This is a curses
tool for debugging the AI, so it might go crazy >.>
